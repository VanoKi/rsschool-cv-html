### About myself:
*For 11 years I worked as a firefighter. I was rescuing people, cats, dogs and, once,
even ducklings. But over time, I realized that I had reached the limit in my development.
All these years I have been interested in information technology. And now the time has come to
go to a new boundless world in which there are no limits for development.
This new field of activity has absorbed me so much that I will not stop on the way to my goal:
to become a senior Fullstack developer. Discipline is not an empty words for me, over the years
I have learned to complete the assigned tasks accurately and in time, acquired stress resistance
and developed resourcefulness and the ability to think outside the box. Such my qualities as
purposefulness and perseverance will help me in this.*

### My Skills:
